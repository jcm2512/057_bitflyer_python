### How to Write Simple Notes and Keep Them with Your Repo:

1. **Create a Markdown File:**

   - You can create a `.md` file in your repository. For example, you might create a `NOTES.md` or `README.md` file.

2. **Write Your Notes:**

   - Open the `.md` file in any text editor (like VSCode) and start writing your notes using Markdown syntax.

3. **Commit and Push the File:**

   - Once youâ€™ve written your notes, save the file and add it to your Git repository:
     ```bash
     git add NOTES.md
     git commit -m "Add project notes"
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Access and Update Your Notes:**
   - You can update your Markdown notes at any time by editing the `.md` file and committing the changes.
